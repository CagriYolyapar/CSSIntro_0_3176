     CSS,sizin tasarımınızı daha ayrıntılı bir şekilde güzelleştirmenizi ve şeikllendirmenizi saglayan bir dildir (Cascading Style Sheet)


        Sizin CSS yazabilmeniz 3 yöntem vardır:


        1 => Inline CSS yazmak : Start tag'inin icerisine style attribute'u vererek CSS yazmaktır...Tekrarlı kullanılmayacak ve sadece ilgili elemente stil verecek bir kodu yazmak istediginizde tercih edilir...Inline css yazıldıgında yer itibariyle diger yöntemde yazılan bütün css durumları ezilir (Inline CSS her zaman öncelige sahiptir)


        2 => Internal CSS yazmak : Aynı sayfada tekrarlı CSS kullanmak isterseniz veya Inline CSS'te yazabileceginizden daha fazla CSS kodu varsa bu noktada internal CSS yazarsınız. Internal CSS sayfanızın her tarafına yazılabilecek olsa da en saglıklı olanı head taglerinin arasına yazmaktır...

        3 => External CSS yazmak :Birden fazla sayfada kullanmak istedigimiz veya cok kompleks ve uzun CSS kodları artık external CSS'e yazılırlar. External CSS sayesinde siz aslında bir CSS dosyası olusturuyorsunuz ve onu birden fazla sayfada kullanabilir hale geliyorsunuz...


        *selectors

        --Isme göre 
        Siz bir tag'i ismiyle secebilirsiniz.  Ancak sayfadaki bütün o tagler'i secmiş olursunuz.


        p{
          background-color:red;
        
        }



        --ID'ye göre secmek

        #xyx1{
          
            background-color : red;
        
        }

        -- class'a göre secmek

        .a{
            background-color : red;
        }


        class ve id secilerek yapılan tasarımlar her zaman isimle secilenlere göre daha öncelikle render pozisyonuna aittir (ezilmezler)

        id > class > tag
